# Engine.IO SPEC

## Revision

This is revision **1** of the Engine.IO protocol.

## Anatomy of an Engine.IO session

1. Transport establishes a connection to the Engine.IO URL .
2. Server responds with an `open` packet with JSON-encoded handshake data:
  - `sid` session id (`String`)
  - `upgrades` possible transport upgrades (`Array` of `String`)
  - `pingTimeout` server configured ping timeout, used for the client
    to detect that the server is unresponsive (`Number`)
3. Client must respond to periodic `ping` packets sent by the server
with `pong` packets.
4. Client and server can exchange `message` packets at will.
5. Polling transports can send a `close` packet to close the socket, since
they're expected to be "opening" and "closing" all the time.

## URLs

An Engine.IO url is composed as follows:

`/engine.io` ? <query string>

The query string has three reserved keys:

- `transport`: indicates the transport name. Supported ones by default are
  `polling`, `flashsocket`, `websocket`.
- `j`: if the transport is `polling` but a JSONP response is required, `j`
  must be set with the JSONP response index.
- `sid`: if the client has been given a session id, it must be included
  in the querystring.

## Encoding

There's two distinct types of encodings

- packet
- payload

### Packet

The packet encoding format is as follows

```
<packet type id> [ `:` <data> ]
```

The packet type id is an integer. The following are the accepted packet
types.

```
open     0
close    1
ping     2
pong     3
message  4
upgrade  5
```

An encoded packet is a UTF-8 string.

### Payload

A payload is a series of encoded packets tied together.

## Transports

An engine.io server must support three transports:

- websocket
- flashsocket
- polling
  - jsonp
  - xhr

### Polling

The polling transport consists of recurring GET requests by the client
to the server to get data, and POST requests with payloads from the
client to the server to send data.

#### XHR

The server must support CORS responses.

#### JSONP

The server implementation must respond with valid JavaScript. The URL
contains a query string parameter `j` that must be used in the response.
`j` is an integer.

The format of a JSONP packet.

```
`___eio[` <j> `]("` <encoded payload> `");`
```

To ensure that the payload gets processed correctly, it must be escaped
in such a way that the response is still valid JavaScript. Passing the
encoded payload through a JSON encoder is a good way to escape it.

Example JSONP frame returned by the server:

```
___eio[4]("packet data");
```

##### Posting data

The client posts data through a hidden iframe. The data gets to the server
in the URI encoded format as follows:

```
d=<escaped packet payload>
```

In addition to the regular qs escaping, in order to prevent
inconsistencies with `\n` handling by browsers, `\n` gets escaped as `\\n`
prior to being POSTd.

### WebSocket

Encoding payloads _should not_ be used for WebSocket, as the protocol
already has a lightweight framing mechanism.

In order to send a payload of messages, encode packets individually
and `send()` them in succession.

## Transport upgrading

A connection always starts with polling (either XHR or JSONP). WebSocket
gets tested on the side by sending a probe. If the probe is responded
from the server, an upgrade packet is sent.

To ensure no messages are lost, the upgrade packet will only be sent
once all the buffers of the existing transport are flushed and the
transport is considered _paused_.

When the server receives the upgrade packet, it must assume this is the
new transport channel and send all existing buffers (if any) to it.

The probe sent by the client is a `ping` packet with `probe` sent as data.
The probe sent by the server is a `pong` packet with `probe` sent as data.

Moving forward, upgrades other than just `polling -> x` are being considered.

## Timeouts

The client must use the `pingTimeout` sent as part of the handshake (with
the `open` packet) to determine whether the server is unresponsive.

If no packet type is received withing `pingTimeout`, the client considers
the socket disconnected.
